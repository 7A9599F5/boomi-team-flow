  CREATE Component in Primary Account via Partner API

  HTTP Method: POST
  URL: https://api.boomi.com/partner/api/rest/v1/{primaryAccountId}/Component~{branchId}

  Headers:
    Accept: application/xml
    Content-Type: application/xml

  Notes:
    - componentId should be EMPTY or omitted for creation (API assigns new ID)
    - Tilde syntax (~{branchId}) writes the new component to the promotion branch instead of main
    - folderFullPath: /Promoted{devFolderFullPath} - mirrors the dev account's folder hierarchy under /Promoted/
      (e.g., dev path /DevTeamARoot/Orders/MyProcess/ becomes /Promoted/DevTeamARoot/Orders/MyProcess/)
      Folders are auto-created by the API if they don't exist
    - The <bns:object> contains the stripped and reference-rewritten XML from dev
    - Response returns the new componentId and version=1
    - The component exists only on the branch until merged to main via MergeRequest
