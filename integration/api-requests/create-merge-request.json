  "_NOTE": "MergeRequest field names have a three-way inconsistency across the codebase: (1) build guide 11 + appendix curl #8 + page7 layout use 'source', (2) build guide 02 + all skills files + this template use 'sourceBranchId', (3) target field is 'targetBranchId' here but implicit in build guide. Needs live API testing to confirm which field names the API actually accepts. Do NOT change field names until verified against the live Boomi Platform API.",
